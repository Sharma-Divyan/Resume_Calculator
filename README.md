The Resume Match Score Calculator is a smart Python-based tool that helps job seekers evaluate how well their resume aligns with a specific job description.
Using NLP (Natural Language Processing) techniques, it extracts content from a PDF resume, processes both the resume and job description text, and calculates a match score based on keyword 
similarity using TF-IDF and cosine similarity. A simple and interactive Streamlit web interface allows users to upload resumes, paste job descriptions, and instantly get match feedback with 
actionable tips.
